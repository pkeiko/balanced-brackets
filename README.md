# balanced-brackets

This repository contains the code that solves the balanced brackets problem.

Given a int value that represents the number of brackets sequences followed by the sequences themselves, it will write down the result of each sequence in a file called `output.xlsx`.

## How to run

```bash
python balanced_brackets.py
```

and an input following the same format as:

```bash
3
{[()]}
{[(])}
{{[[(())]]}}
```
